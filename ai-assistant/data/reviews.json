Recent past exams are useful for test prep. Homework is easy. Projects are challenging. Watch the videos before class. A wide division in the class between ppl knows how to code vs. ppl first-time coding.",

It is very easy to pass the class though if you finish all of the homeworks, labs, & projects. The exams are extremely hard, partial credit is nice though.
